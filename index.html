          <h3>What is Flood Restoration?</h3>
          <p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?cid=6174679116023554639"><b>Flood Restoration</b></a> is the professional process of cleaning, repairing, and restoring a property after it has been damaged by flooding. It involves more than just removing standing water — it includes drying out the structure, dehumidifying hidden moisture, cleaning and disinfecting affected areas (since floodwater is often contaminated), preventing mold growth, and repairing or replacing damaged materials such as flooring, drywall, and insulation.

                <div class="accordion-body">The time depends on several factors: the amount of water, how quickly cleanup begins, the extent of structural damage, materials involved, and whether mold or contamination is present. For minor flooding, restoration can take a few days; for major flood damage with structural repairs, it may take several weeks.

                <div class="accordion-body">Often yes, but it depends on your policy. Standard homeowners insurance usually covers sudden and accidental fire damage. Flood damage may require a separate flood insurance policy. Be sure to report damage promptly, document everything, and work with experienced restoration professionals (like Water And Fire Damage Restoration) to provide detailed estimates and damage assessment.</div>

                <div class="accordion-body">Cleaning up water damage might mean removing standing water, drying surfaces, and cleaning up visible mess. Full restoration includes deeper work: drying and dehumidification of hidden moisture, mold prevention, repairing or replacing damaged structural materials (drywall, flooring, framing), possibly restoring contents and finishing touches. Full restoration ensures safety and long-term stability.
